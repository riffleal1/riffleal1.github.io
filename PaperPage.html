            <h2> Using multidimensional space to teach plant science </h2>

                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                <p>	The biology of plants is comprised of a complex network of systems, processes, and interacting parts. Many of these parts are microscopic and difficult, or even impossible to see with the human eye. Botany textbooks often teach these microscopic concepts using separated diagrams and text for each process but don’t generally include a central diagram that displays how all of the processes work together. Because of this, it can be difficult for students to grasp an idea of how plants work overall. This project will explore the use of multi-dimensional space in teaching major botanical functions. This should create an easier-to-follow and more engaging workspace for students to learn about botany.</p>

                <h5>The Process of Teaching Botany</h5>
                <p>	Botany is a subject that is very often neglected in high school and college courses. According to David R. Hershey (1996), much of this neglect is due to the fact that the science of plants is often seen as inferior to the science of animal and human biology. There is also an additional lack in accurate media and resources available for teachers, leaving both educators and students deficient in botanical knowledge. Much of today’s accurate botanical literature is located in various journals and books across universities, and has no central access point for teachers. Even the current “database” for botanical teaching literature is outdated (Hershey, 1996). When teachers do have access to accurate information, it can still be difficult to find effective methods for teaching. F.E. Lloyd’s book, “The Best Methods of Teaching Botany to School Students,” claims that students are most engaged when they’re taught using hands-on learning experiments, but because of the microscopic nature of many plants, this can be difficult. It is also hard to give students an overarching idea of how a plant works as a whole system using hands-on learning, because while one plant may have large enough parts to observe without a microscope, it may not react as quickly as another plant to photosynthetic processes, and therefore students must work with a multitude of different real-life examples in order to gain an understanding of all of the separate processes in plant science (Lloyd, 1911).  Frederic E. Clements stated similar advice for instructors in “The Ecological Method in Teaching Biology,” and claimed that botanical study should be conducted on real plants and in the field whenever possible for maximum student understanding. </p>

                <h5>Three Dimensional Learning</h5>
                <p>	According to a study done by Tarek M. Abdelhamid at the University of Auckland School of Medicine and Health Science, the “use of pictoral images can aid the learning processes better than verbal description.” Because of this, many botany textbooks are filled with diagrams that show plant processes, but even with detailed descriptions, these diagrams can be hard to understand. That same study also suggests that images are more easily-memorized if data is presented in a single visual image, and multi-dimensional learning can enhance memorization by encouraging students to think about interconnections between different concepts or processes (Abdelhamid, 1999). A few companies, such as Kno, an online textbook retailor, have tried to build on this idea of multi-dimensional learning for biology students by releasing eTextbooks that can render 3D models of certain objects, typically chemical structures. According to Julius Motal (2011), these 3D features are limited to singular objects, rather than interconnecting whole processes. However, adding the 3-dimensional aspect still gives a better representation of specific objects than a 2-dimensional diagram would, and could very easily become a classroom norm in the future (Motal, 2011). Other companies, such as Cyber Science 3D and Gale, a part of Cengage Learning, are also in the process of developing new 3D technology to enhance teaching and learning experiences in a large network of schools and universities. According to Sean Flynn of Cyber Science 3D, three-dimensional technology for the sciences will help promote information discovery, enable learning, and promote the growth of knowledge in communities. </p>

                <h5>Solution</h5>
                <p>	In order to improve the learning process and promote engagement in botany classes, I decided to create an interactive animation that allowed users to see plant processes on both a large scale, and on smaller scales that would not be visible with the human eye. In modern botany textbooks, diagrams are only single-dimensional and don’t show the motion and interactions of molecules, enzymes, and other essential parts. Two and three-dimensional animations show these interactions between parts, but often don’t contain as much depth in the information given, and move more quickly than if the information was read and re-read out of a textbook.
My solution is a cyclical animation that the user can control and customize to focus on the processes that they want to learn about. The animation will have text that explains what is happening in the process on a full scale. When the user clicks on an individual molecule or part, there will also be a definition and description of what role that part plays in the process. By giving users multiple levels of interaction with the process, it will help them interact, memorize, and understand the process that they are learning. It will also allow them to control their learning pace and customize their environment, narrowing in on specifics when they need it but still being able to back up and see the bigger picture.

                <h5>Process</h5>
                <p>	Initially, this project was meant to encompass all plant processes, as well as three-dimensional labeled diagrams of plants. However, in order to fit into the time frame of one semester, I worked with Dr. Nancy Smith-Huerta of Miami University’s Botany Department to choose a single process to focus on. Photosynthesis, specifically the Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis, was the process that I chose, because it is generally taught to high school students and entry-level college students who have little to no prior experience in Biology classes and likely need aid in learning botanical processes.
 </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with Dr. Smith-Huerta’s Biology 191: Plant Science course at Miami University over the course of the semester to acquire feedback and learn about the target users for this project. This specific class had 31 students, 23 of whom were underclassmen (freshmen and sophomores). Only four of those students (around 13%) were actually majoring in a biology-related subject, such as botany or zoology. Because of these demographics, and because of the intricate and detailed nature of botanical sciences, most of the “building” part of this project was spent using Maya software to create an accurate and understandable three-dimensional model of each of the parts of the photosynthetic process, and reiterating the animation and models based on student feedback. Some time was also spent developing mockups for what the application could look like in the future, and student feedback was also taken into account in making an interface that gave just enough explanation and definition, without becoming to cluttered, confusing, and textbook-like. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, the model was simple and not too strongly textured, in order to draw attention to the process and movements rather than the intricacy of the models. The shapes of the enzymes and photosystems, though simple, were accurate to the shapes of the real objects that they depicted. Molecules, photons, and electrons were represented with different colored spheres, since they are generally depicted as circles in two-dimensional diagrams. The interface mockup contained simple, easy-to-understand controls and a box of text for the object definition, while a text explaining an overview of the selected process appeared one line at a time, rather than scrolled, across the bottom of the page.

                <h5>Results</h5>
                <p>	After presenting the final animation and interface to the Bio 191 class, the following feedback was given:</p>
                 <p>
                 0% of the students in the class would prefer to learn and study using a textbook alone. 6 of the students (19.35%) would prefer to learn and study using just the animation. All other students, (80.65%) said that they would prefer to use both the textbook and animation to learn and study.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 87% of the students in the class found the animation easier to understand than a textbook diagram. 9.68% thought they were about the same. Only one out of 31 students found the animation harder to understand than a textbook.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 When asked about how frequently they would use the animation over the textbook, most students (18) said they would use the animation often, but would still use the textbook occasionally. Ten of the students (32.26%) said that they would use the animation all of the time, instead of using a textbook. Three students (9.68%) said that they would use the animation rarely, only when they didn’t understand something from the textbook. Zero students said that they would never use the animation. These frequencies are assuming that the textbook is offered for free through their university.

                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>	Based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback from real Biology students who have learned these processes, it is easy to see that multi-dimensional learning should definitely be considered as a major method of teaching. Many introductory-level students would benefit from, and even enjoy, the use of three-dimensional learning in the classroom. The use of this application and these animations would greatly improve student interactions and understanding, and would allow them to gain a well-rounded view of processes. It would help students learn to understand how these processes work together on a large scale, while still allowing them to see small details and individual working parts. It would promote engagement and holistic understanding, rather than the memorization of individual names and diagrams just for a test. This application could be applied to several other scientific processes to create other three-dimensional applications and interactive animations, which would drastically improve the way botany is taught in schools, and it would engage students in a learning environment where they understand both the small processes and the bigger picture.
